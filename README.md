# UI/UX Redesign Summary (Dec 2025)

The frontend UI/UX was redesigned for a modern, professional fintech experience:
- **Consistent card-based layouts** for all main pages, improving clarity and visual grouping.
- **Soft neutral palette with a purple accent** for trust and brand recognition.
- **Wallet/financial icons** reinforce the app’s purpose and build user trust.
- **Improved spacing, alignment, and typography** for readability and a premium feel.
- **Responsive layouts** using Flexbox/Grid for desktop and mobile friendliness.
- **Minimal, clutter-free forms and navigation** for a clear user flow (Register → Login → Dashboard → Gam3ya).
- **Consistent button styles** and clear call-to-actions throughout.

These changes make the app feel more trustworthy, easy to use, and visually appealing—key for any fintech product.
